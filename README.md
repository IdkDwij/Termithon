# READ ME FIRST IF CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR SECURITY (FIXED IN v1.6)

### THIS Only applies to .zip releases (Dubbed as UNSAFE Edition)

VirusTotal detects this file as malicious. (_it *OBVIOUSLY* isn't a virus because it's open source_)

If you use MalwareBytes, SecureAge APEX, or Trellix (FireEye) as your Antivirus, it may flag this file as a false positive. 

MalwareBytes: Malware.AI.3860805198

SecureAge APEX: Malicious

Trellix (FireEye): Generic.mg.1f067e9e75eabd2e

If you are in a school that has Carbon Black Sensor, it WILL detect PyPrompt as a virus. It's a false positive. (Only applies to multi-file releases, i will now release single executable releases to prevent this issue)

[VirusTotal Scan for PyPrompt v1.5.1 Beta 1](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e7a956e297a97566fb7e3c08ff20962f1fb45cbda81abc8595cc25695de3af34)

## Run this in your PC

First download python from [python.org](https://python.org). (ONLY REQUIRED FOR PYPROMPT DEVELOPMENT, BETA RELEASES, OR UNCOMPILED BUILDS)

For stable builds: download the binary or the setup from the 'Releases' tab.

### TO RUN IN WINDOWS TERMINAL

locate your downloaded release (pyprompt.exe) and copy it to the root of your C drive and make a new profile named PyPrompt, use the following command ```C:\pyprompt.exe``` once you copy it, it should work.

### Why isn't there an ```.exe``` version?

What do you mean? It's a thing now!

### What happened to PyPrompt Development Kit?

Just get the code from here and use the included pyinstaller and auto py to exe (WILL WORK IN v1.6 BETA 2) to compile your own version!


## Features:

There's a lot...

PyPrompt Modes:

CMD Mode (If usual Windows Shell commands are broken in PyPrompt, just use the 'cmd' command and you are in vanilla Command Prompt.)
         (NOTE: You are still in the PyPrompt App. Exit by typing exit in CMD Mode)
Bash Mode (Same as CMD Mode but you can run UNIX commands. Again, this is just a sidemode. You can return by typing exit or logoff.)

```

## Compatability:

Windows: Supports Windows 10 or 8.1

Linux: Any Linux distro (requires python) (uncompiled build, don't think i'm going to compile for linux...)

macOS: There is no current build now (yet)
