# READ ME FIRST IF CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR SECURITY

### THIS Only applies to .zip releases (Dubbed as UNSAFE Edition)

VirusTotal detects this file as malicious. (_it *OBVIOUSLY* isn't a virus because it's open source_)

If you use MalwareBytes, SecureAge APEX, or Trellix (FireEye) as your Antivirus, it may flag this file as a false positive. 

MalwareBytes: Malware.AI.3860805198

SecureAge APEX: Malicious

Trellix (FireEye): Generic.mg.1f067e9e75eabd2e

If you are in a school that has Carbon Black Sensor, it WILL detect PyPrompt as a virus. It's a false positive.

[VirusTotal Scan for PyPrompt v1.5.1 Beta 1](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e7a956e297a97566fb7e3c08ff20962f1fb45cbda81abc8595cc25695de3af34)

## Run this in your PC

First download python from [python.org](https://python.org). (Applicable to beta builds or .py/.pyc builds)

For stable builds: download the binary or the setup from the 'Releases' tab.

### TO RUN IN WINDOWS TERMINAL

Name the PyPrompt file to prompt.py and put it on the root of the C drive. In Windows Terminal, make a new profile, named PyPrompt. use the following command. ```python.exe C:\prompt.py``` or ```py C:\prompt.py``` Run that new profile. PyPrompt should work.

### Why isn't there an ```.exe``` version?

What do you mean? It's a thing now!

## What is this PyPrompt Development Kit?...

It's the necessary tools needed to compile PyPrompt to a ```.pyc``` format. (_You may need to re-compile for different computers. Else it won't work..._)

I will upload it soon. Check this document regularly... I might just put it HERE: Download [PyDevKit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TtT72DXU6JIxWEfVa3aCU3BXcDBVyjmb/view?usp=sharing) (Not yet on 1.5)

You may need to delete the compiled version i pre made. It might not work. Run ```compilePrompt.py``` or whatever its called and it will compile the necessary files needed.


## Features:

PyPrompt Modes:

CMD Mode (If usual Windows Shell commands are broken in PyPrompt, just use the 'cmd' command and you are in vanilla Command Prompt.)
         (NOTE: You are still in the PyPrompt App. Exit by typing exit in CMD Mode)
Bash Mode (Same as CMD Mode but you can run UNIX commands. Again, this is just a sidemode. You can return by typing exit or logoff.)

```

## Compatability:

Windows: Supports Windows 10 or 8.1

Linux: Any Linux distro (requires python) (uncompiled build, don't think i'm going to compile for linux...)

macOS: There is no current build now (yet)
