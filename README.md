### Engine based on Termithon by idkDwij

Inspired by: [This repo!](https://github.com/IdkDwij/Termithon)


## Run this in your PC

First download python from [python.org](https://python.org). Once it's installed, Run the PyPrompt file from the 'Releases' tab. 

### TO RUN IN WINDOWS TERMINAL

Name the PyPrompt file to prompt.py and put it on the root of the C drive. In Windows Terminal, make a new profile, named PyPrompt. use the following command. ```python.exe C:\prompt.py``` or ```py C:\prompt.py``` Run that new profile. PyPrompt should work.

### Why isn't there an ```.exe``` version?

Using pyinstaller it gives me an error (_apparently about the main() function. idk why it happens_)

## What is this PyPrompt Development Kit?...

It's the necessary tools needed to compile PyPrompt to a ```.pyc``` format. (_You may need to re-compile for different computers. Else it won't work..._)

I will upload it soon. Check this document regularly... I might just put it HERE: Download [PyDevKit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TtT72DXU6JIxWEfVa3aCU3BXcDBVyjmb/view?usp=sharing)

You may need to delete the compiled version i pre made. It might not work. Run ```compilePrompt.py``` or whatever its called and it will compile the necessary files needed.


## Features:

Many...
